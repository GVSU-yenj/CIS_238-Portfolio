		<p>Thank you for wanting to contact me. I will always try to reply promptly, especially in the mornings. Unless you're just trying to be a jerk... in which case, please be sure to leave your mother's contact info so I can tell her that you need to relearn your manners.</p>

		<h2>Fax</h2>
		
		<p> Yeah, I know... I'm surprised I have a fax machine too, but it was insisted by every business prof I ever had, so here I am. Also the fact that every printer just kinda comes with one means I've had one without having known it for 3 years, so that was nice! Probably not gonna be too responsive to this method of contact because... it's 2020? Uhh? </p>

		<h2>Phone</h2>
		
<div class="tablet">
		<p> This is probably the best way to reach me if the situation is urgent. I should always have my phone on me, and if I do not reply then it is the rare case where: I forgot my phone, have it off, or the battery is dead, in which case I will reply at the end of the day. Also, I may be at a social gathering (which is not rare of me, surprise surprise). Feel free to also text me; I will not reply to texts when driving. I also check voicemails semi-daily.</p>
</div>
<div class="mobile">
		<p> This is the best way of reaching me! If I'm not around I will return to your call/text as soon as possible with a reason for my absence!</p>
